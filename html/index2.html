<h1>Golden Ratio in Art and Architecture</h1>

<h2>By Samuel Obara</h2>


<P>According to NCTM's Principles and Standard for School Mathematics(2000),
rich problems contexts involve connections to other disciplines,
(e.g. science, social studies, art) as well as to the real world
and to the daily life experience of middle-grades students(NCTM,
2000, p.374). <BR>
An exploration with the golden ratio offers opportunities to connect
an understanding the conceptions of ratio and proportion to geometry.
The mathematical connections between geometry and algebra can
be highlighted by connecting Phi to the Fibonacci numbers and
some golden figures. <BR>
Also, the golden ratio is a good topic to introduce historic and
aesthetic elements to a mathematical concept, because we can find
that not a few artists and architects were connected with the
golden ratio of their works through much of the art history.</P>

<P>The one of purposes of this project is to overview the golden
ratio briefly. The other is to introduce the occurrences of the
golden ratio in art and architecture.</P>

<P>The content includes the following :</P>

<P>I.A discovery of the Golden Ratio<BR>
A. A brief history of the Golden Ratio<BR>
B. Definitions of the Golden Ratio related to Fibonacci sequence
number<BR>
II. Some Golden Geometry<BR>
III. The Golden Ratio in Art and Architecture<BR>
IV. Resources<BR>
